Assignment 2

Q. Difference between defination, declaration and initialisation.

	In declaration, the variable is usually not given a value

	You declare JavaScript variables with the var keyword: var animal;

	After the declaration, the variable is empty (it has no value).
	
	Declaration allocates memory. 


	when defining, a variable is  declared and given a value for memory collection

	To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign var animal="dog"; 
	
	Definition assigns a value to the allocated memory.


	Initialization means you are assigning the initial value to the variable

	From the above statement we can freely debote that the initial value of a variable is undefined
